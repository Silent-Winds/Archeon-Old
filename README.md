## üè∑Ô∏è Welcome to Archeon and the Echo of the Worlds

The Silent Winds team presents the Archeon mod! Archeon is a brand new dimension, full of new blocks, mobs and more! All you need to get there is a portal made of Mysterious Stone, filled with a magical energy made by the Wand of Nature! The Archeon mod is still in heavy development, but we already released the Rebirth of History update a a few months ago! Go check it out on CurseForge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/archeon/files - The current in-dev update of Archeon is called Archeon and the Echo of the Worlds, the third arc of the mod. Although, we totally moved to the QUILT modloader for better optimization and easier updates!

## üíé Found an Issue?

With the mod being fully rewritten for QuiltMC, there will not be Forge updates for Archeon anymore. The Quilt version is now fully worked on, and the Forge version is abandonned. And so, bug reports would be useless in this repository. Although, feel free to tell us if you have rebalances to propose or things like that!
