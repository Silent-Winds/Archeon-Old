## 🏷️ Welcome to Archeon: Rebirth of History

The Silent Winds team presents the Archeon mod! Archeon is a brand new dimension, full of new blocks, mobs and more! All you need to get there is a portal made of Mysterious Stone, filled with a magical energy made by the Wand of Nature! The Archeon mod is still in heavy development, currently in a retexture phase. The dimension for now includes only blocks and items, and at the moment only 1 mob, but this will change in a bit of time! Archeon: Rebirth of History is the second update of the mod, the first named Archeon: The Adventure Begins. Snapshots of the new update can be downloaded on our Discord server, and the currnt realease on our <a class="github-button" href="https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/archeon
